A notable exception can be made for Propy. To my knowledge, this platform is the only one today capable of unifying and standardizing property listings in global cities, whether in the US, China, Russia, the Middle-East and Europe. If you add to that their ability to provide instant purchase deposit in escrow and manage transaction payment services, Propy is well on its way to automatizing the purchase process all the way to online title delivery. It is potentially a game-changer in our industry.",
