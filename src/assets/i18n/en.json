A notable exception can be made for Propy. To my knowledge, this platform is the only one today capable of unifying and standardizing property listings in global cities, whether in the US, China, Russia, the Middle-East and Europe. If you add to that their ability to provide instant purchase deposit in escrow and manage transaction payment services, Propy is well on its way to automatizing the purchase process all the way to online title delivery. It is potentially a game-changer in our industry.",

Andrey Zamovski is very intelligent and innovative at usage of his deep knowledge of cryptography and Ethereum Smart Contracts. The team is also international - founders and early employees from Russia, Ukraine, US and Singapore are sharing the knowledge of their markets.",

			"gardner-words": "Beyond finance, real estate is perhaps the most obvious industry prime for being upended by blockchain technology. With its superb team and strong vision Propy is likely to be a leader as real estate is dirsupted by this revolutionary innovation."
